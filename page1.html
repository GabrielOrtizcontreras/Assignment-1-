          <ol type="I">
          <li> First new concept: Nested List </li>
            <ol type="i"> 
            <li> You can sort them anyway. </li>
            <li> You can manipulate the fonts and change how they are labeled as well. </li>
            </ol>
     
          <li> Second new concept: Changing Fonts </li>
          <ol type="i"> 
            <li> You can use many different fonts and in many different forms </li>
            <li> You can make the font smaller or larger and make many different cool styles. </li>
          </ol>

          <li> Third new concept: Making Tables </li>
          <ol type="i"> 
          <li> You can make a neat looking table that can have different colors to make a website look as legitimate for people to look at. </li>
          <li> You can list as many rows and columns as you like and they will look great as well as change the fonts within the table itself. </li>

            <p style="text-align:center;"><small> In repl.it, click on My Repls. Add a folder called Assignments and click it. The site will offer to create another HTML repl inside that Assignments folder for you. Accept. This is your Assignments repl.

            Add an images folder. You can drag & drop images here. Add a banner image.

            index.html

            Use semantic tags to divide the page into these logical sections:
            header, nav, main, and footer

            Add a banner-type image to the header semantic tag. Note that you have to include the images folder in the path.

            In the nav sematic tag, define a navigation for the Assignments 1 site including Home, Page 1 and Page 2, and CSUâ€™s main page.

            Add information to the footer: contact info, name, etc. You can use fictional business info.

            This index page is now your site template. Copy it to two additional files so they are all the same so far. Create page1.html and page2.html.

            In the main, welcome the user to your site using h1 - h6, p tags.

            Scroll down to the end to get instructions to do your first Github commit now.
